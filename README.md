# SDL Joystick Object by PkR

SDL Joystick is an extension for Clickteam Fusion 2.5 that makes use of [SDL2 Joystick API](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15/docs/html/joystick.html) to interface with game controllers.

To make the source code compilable, put it into an `SDLJoystick` folder and place it in Windows EDIF SDK's `Extensions` folder.
