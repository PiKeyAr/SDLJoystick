<p><b>Add controller mapping from file<br>
  </b>Adds controller mappings from the file, for less common controllers. The commonmost ones have their mappings included with the extension.<br> Examples of mapping files and tools for generating them are available <a href="https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB">here</a>.<br>
It's recommended to allow the user to load their own mapping files, rather than try to do it all yourself.</p>
